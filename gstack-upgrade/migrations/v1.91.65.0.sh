# Migration: v1.91.65.0 — install footprint (#1694). The release queue may
# rename this file at /ship; it must match VERSION.
#
# Installs used to render every host's skills inside the checkout, so a global
# Claude install carried ~576 extra SKILL.md files (32 MB) that Claude Code and
# Cursor-agent scan. Record the hosts this install already serves (registry
# rows, install roots that resolve here, host skills that link into its
# renders), then prune the renders of every other host with
# bin/gstack-host-renders.sh: generated files are backed up under
# $GSTACK_STATE_ROOT/backups/host-renders/, anything not proven generated stays.
# ./setup runs the same prune on every run; this covers an install upgraded
# without one. Idempotent and non-fatal.
