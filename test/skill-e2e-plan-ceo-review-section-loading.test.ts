/**
 * /plan-ceo-review section-loading E2E (periodic, paid, SDK capture) — v2 plan
 * Phase B carve backstop. The per-PR guard is the free static test
 * skill-ceo-section-ordering.test.ts; THIS is the behavioral proof that a real
 * agent actually Reads the carved section instead of working from memory.
 *
 * Detection is LOSSLESS. Earlier this test drove a real PTY and scraped the ANSI
 * screen buffer for the `sections/<file>.md` path. That silently saw nothing in a
 * Conductor PTY — cursor-positioned tool renders and an unanswered Step 0 question
 * loop both defeat the regex, so it reported `read: []` even when the agent did the
 * work. It now runs the skill through `claude -p` (the SDK path the AUQ matrix
 * uses) and detects section reads from the tool-use stream (`Read` calls whose
 * file_path contains `sections/review-sections.md`). No rendering layer to mangle.
 *
 * Hermetic, not install-mutating: the freshly-generated worktree skeleton +
 * sections are copied into a throwaway fixture dir and the absolute path is pinned,
 * so the test validates THIS branch's carve without touching the user's active
 * ~/.claude install. (Install-layout linking is covered separately by
 * setup-sections-linking.test.ts.)
 *
 * The agent is told AskUserQuestion is unavailable, so it auto-picks the
 * recommended option through Step 0 and reaches the post-Step-0 STOP-Read. HOLD
 * SCOPE is the simplest mode that still requires the full review section. Cost:
 * ~$1-2/run. Periodic tier.
