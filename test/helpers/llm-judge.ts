4. Construct correct command invocations without guessing

Rate the following ${section} on three dimensions (1-5 scale):

- **actionability** (1-5): Can an agent construct correct command invocations from this reference alone?

Scoring guide:

- 3: Adequate — some guessing required
- 2: Poor — significant info missing

- 4: Reason is concrete and option-specific but does NOT explicitly compare against an alternative (e.g. "because Redis gives sub-millisecond reads under load", "because the new schema removes the JOIN we were paying for").
- 3: Reason is real but generic — could apply to many options ("because it's faster", "because it's simpler", "because it ships sooner").
- 2: Reason restates the option label or is near-tautological ("because it's the hybrid one", "because that's the recommended approach").
- 1: Reason is boilerplate / empty ("because it's better", "because it works", "because it's the right choice").
