/**
 * Canonical carved-skill guard registry — the single source of truth for which
 * skills are carved (skeleton SKILL.md + on-demand sections/*.md) and what each
 * carve must guarantee.
 *
 * PURE LEAF DATA MODULE (codex outside-voice #1, refined-plan pass): this file
 * has NO runtime imports — `import type` only. parity-harness.ts and
 * skill-size-budget.test.ts derive their carved-skill lists FROM here (no
 * parallel hand-maintained lists), so a runtime import back into either of them
 * would create a cycle. Keep it data.
 *
 * Consumers:
 *   - test/carve-section-ordering.test.ts   (E2, gate)  → staticInvariants
 *   - test/carve-section-loading.test.ts    (T2, periodic) → requiredReads + scenario
 *   - test/carve-guard-completeness.test.ts (E1, gate)  → the set must equal the
 *                                                          filesystem carved set
 *   - test/carve-guards-negative.test.ts    (ET1, gate) → injects a broken fixture
 *   - test/helpers/parity-harness.ts        → sectioned/maxSkeletonBytes/minBytes/mustContain
 *   - test/skill-size-budget.test.ts        → SECTIONS_EXTRACTED = CARVED_SKILLS
 *
 * Adding a carve = add one entry here (atomically, in the same commit as the
 * skeleton + manifest + sections — codex #4 — so E1's bidirectional parity never
 * false-positives mid-commit).
