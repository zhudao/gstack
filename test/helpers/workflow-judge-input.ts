On-demand sections retain their original file boundaries and Read instructions; the section
index refers to those files, not duplicate work. The bundle order is not execution order.
Judge the actual instructions, including contradictory ordering or missing decisions.${opts.agentCapability === 'frontier' ? `

Target reader: a frontier coding agent with GPT-5.6 Sol-level capability or stronger.
Assume it can follow explicit cross-references, track saved state and a bounded work list,
and distinguish conditional branches. Length, technical vocabulary and multiple explicit recovery paths alone are not clarity defects.
Do not invent missing policies, permissions or evidence to make a workflow executable.

Clarity 4 means the target agent can determine the next permitted action on each applicable path;
5 additionally means those paths are easy to locate and understand.
Score clarity 3 or lower when execution still requires guessing because of
conflicting order, undefined decisions, unclear authority or missing input/output handling.
Evaluate the whole workflow, but keep the JSON reasoning under ${WORKFLOW_JUDGE_REASONING_WORD_TARGET} words with at most two decisive examples.
For a clarity defect, cite the specific file/step and explain the competing actions or missing decision.
Keep completeness and actionability independent: reader capability does not supply missing requirements.` : ''}

Rate on three dimensions (1-5 scale):
- **clarity** (1-5): Can an agent follow the instructions without ambiguity?
- **completeness** (1-5): Are all steps, decision points, and outputs well-defined?
- **actionability** (1-5): Can an agent execute this workflow and produce the expected deliverables?

Respond with ONLY valid JSON:
