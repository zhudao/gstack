 *
 * The weekly periodic CI lane runs EVERY periodic-tier file (EVALS_ALL=1) so
 * tests can't rot invisibly — the coverage contract. A file lands here only
 * when running it weekly is KNOWN waste (documented-red or requires manual
 * hardware), and every entry must carry a tracking pointer with a re-entry
 * condition, so an exclusion is a decision with an owner, not a place tests
 * go to die. Pinned by test/periodic-exclude-policy.test.ts: entries must
 * name real files and carry non-empty reason + tracking.
 *
 * Removing an entry re-activates the file on the next weekly run — that IS
 * the re-entry mechanism.
