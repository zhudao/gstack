  'README.md': `# EvalKit SDK

EvalKit is a Python SDK for ML engineers evaluating LLM responses. The primary
developer writes Python daily, uses a terminal, and wants a local result before
connecting the SDK to production CI. The agreed review posture is DX POLISH:
improve the existing SDK's touchpoints within the beta release scope.

## Getting started

Install with \`python -m pip install evalkit==2.0.0b1\`,
then follow the quickstart's command: \`python examples/first_eval.py\`.
The published package inventory is in docs/package-contents.txt.

The chosen first-success experience is an included, copy-paste demo command:
\`python -m evalkit.demo\`. It evaluates bundled sample responses and prints
real per-example scores plus an overall score. It needs no hosted playground
or new interactive UI. Like every first evaluation, it currently waits for the
mandatory CI check described in docs/current-contracts.md.

The bundled demo already works without a developer API key. Its sample evaluation
uses the shipped mock transport; its mandatory remote CI check uses the included
sample-project binding. No credentials step precedes this first demo result.
The keyless demo still waits for that CI check and has no skip or offline bypass.

After the demo, developers obtain a key for their first live evaluation at
https://console.evalkit.example/settings/api-keys: select the project, choose
Create key, copy the value once, and export EVALKIT_API_KEY in their terminal.
The page also lists existing keys and provides revoke/rotate controls. The
bundled demo does not use this key; live evaluations do.

Expected completed demo output for the bundled sample responses is documented
here; the shipped demo prints this per-example and aggregate score format:

    example 1: score=0.80
    example 2: score=1.00
    overall: score=0.90

See docs/api.md for public API and upgrade behavior, and docs/benchmarks.md for
the completed onboarding study. These documents describe the existing SDK's
behavior; its runtime is maintained separately from this release-planning repo.
`,
  'docs/benchmarks.md': `# Completed onboarding study

The internal comparison measured Python SDK onboarding with the same developer
and machine. Peer SDK A took 2 minutes, B took 4 minutes, and C took 3 minutes.
EvalKit took 6 minutes, including the mandatory 5-minute CI wait. The measurement
starts before installation and ends at the first real evaluation result.

The agreed target is under 2 minutes. The study, target persona, and terminal
demo delivery vehicle are already approved. Timing instrumentation and the
post-beta feedback survey exist and will continue unchanged.
`,
  'docs/current-contracts.md': `# Existing SDK contracts

On a developer's first local evaluation, the SDK requires a successful remote
CI check and blocks for five minutes before returning an evaluation result.
There is no skip flag or offline first-run path. The beta plan retains this gate.

During the required wait, the existing SDK writes a progress line to stderr
every 30 seconds, such as "Waiting for CI check: 90s elapsed of 300s", and reports
when the check finishes. Progress does not bypass the check or return evaluation
results before its required successful completion.

Before the countdown, the SDK already prints what the check verifies and where
to inspect it: "Verifying the sample-project binding with EvalKit CI; inspect
https://ci.evalkit.example/checks/<check-id>; normally completes within 300s."
The URL identifies the check without exposing credentials. If it has not
succeeded at 300s, the SDK reports EVALKIT_CI_TIMEOUT, the check URL, and the
instruction to inspect that check and retry after CI recovers. Its help link
explains the check states and recovery steps. Success is still required before
the first local result; these messages do not change the mandatory wait.

Authentication errors behave exactly as documented in docs/api.md. All other
errors already identify the cause, relevant argument or file, and an actionable
fix. Errors redact secrets. API timeouts, cancellation, rate limits, and retries
are bounded and documented; evaluation IDs prevent duplicate submitted jobs.

The SDK supports Python 3.10+, macOS, Linux, and Windows without Docker. Its
type annotations, offline sample data, mock transport, noninteractive CI mode,
API reference, support contact, changelog, and contributor guide already work.
Telemetry is opt-in. No new hosted service, language binding, or community
program is proposed in this release.
`,
  'docs/api.md': `# Public API retained by the beta plan

The two evaluation functions accept positional arguments:

- \`run_eval(dataset, evaluator)\`
- \`run_batch(evaluator, dataset)\`

Both argument names describe the same concepts. The reversed positional order
is intentional in the current draft; neither function requires keyword arguments.

For an invalid API key, the SDK raises \`AuthError("request failed")\`.
There is no authentication error code, explanation of the cause, or instruction
for replacing the key. The plan retains this message.

Version 1 exposes \`Client.evaluate()\`. Version 2 replaces it with
\`Client.run()\` and removes the old name immediately. No compatibility alias,
deprecation warning, migration guide, or codemod is provided. Other public APIs
retain their existing behavior, and the release changelog is otherwise complete.
