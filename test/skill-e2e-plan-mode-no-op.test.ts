/**
 * Plan-mode-info no-op regression (gate tier, paid, real-PTY).
 *
 * Asserts: when a plan-review skill is invoked OUTSIDE plan mode (no
 * --permission-mode plan flag, no plan-mode reminder injected), the skill
 * still reaches a terminal outcome ('asked' or 'plan_ready'). This is the
 * negative coverage to the per-skill plan-mode smokes — if plan-mode-keyed
 * behavior ever starts misfiring for non-plan-mode sessions (e.g., gating
 * questions on a phrase that isn't there, or the plan-eng/plan-design
 * scope-gate auto-select-B bypass firing without plan mode), this test
 * catches it.
 *
 * Why this matters: outside plan mode, claude doesn't render a native
 * confirmation UI. The skill must drive its own AskUserQuestion. Same
 * runner, same outcome contract — just `inPlanMode: false`.
 *
 * Coverage grew with the scope-gate bypass (plan-mode auto-select B):
 *  - plan-ceo-review: original preamble-misfire regression.
 *  - plan-eng-review / plan-design-review: the bypass must NOT fire outside
 *    plan mode (scopeGateAutoSelectObserved stays false), and when the run
 *    ends in 'asked', the question that fired must be the scope gate itself
 *    (outside plan mode with no named target, the gate is the FIRST
 *    question by contract).
 *  - named-target case: a pasted draft (initialPlanContent) IS an
 *    explicitly-named target, so the gate must NOT ask — and the review
 *    must actually consume the pasted content.
 *
 * Cost note: 4 sequential PTY runs (~3-5 min each) in the gate lane, up
 * from 1 pre-bypass. Selected only when plan-ceo/eng/design or the runner
 * change (see 'plan-mode-no-op' in touchfiles.ts).
