/**
 * /ship review fix loop stays in one invocation (#2391).

 * auto-fixable findings, violating the skill's fully-automated contract.
 * The rendered section must instruct a bounded in-invocation loop
 * (re-test, re-review, max 3 fix cycles) and must never terminate an
 * AUTO-FIX result with a rerun request.
