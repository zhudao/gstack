/**
 * /plan-ceo-review per-finding AskUserQuestion count (periodic, paid, real-PTY).
 *
 * Asserts the load-bearing rule "One issue = one AskUserQuestion call" by
 * driving /plan-ceo-review against a 5-finding seeded plan and counting
 * distinct review-phase AUQs. Passes when count is in [N-1, N+2].
 *
 * Two tests in this file:
 *   - 5-finding distinct fixture: count band assertion + D19 review-report-at-bottom.
 *   - 2-finding paired control (D12 positive control): related findings still
 *     produce 2 distinct AUQs, not 1 batched, when the rule is honored.
 *
 * Tier: periodic. Each run drives Step 0 + 11 review sections end-to-end
 * (~25 min, ~$5/run). Sequential by default per plan §D15. See
 * test/helpers/claude-pty-runner.ts for runPlanSkillCounting internals.

  'not URL query/path parameters; all users share one webhook URL.',
  'The adapter acknowledges missing, nil, or empty user_id metadata with',
  'HTTP 200 and an event-correlated warning before invoking this handler.',
  'For every nonempty external string it performs no SQL-format validation.',

  'The existing webhook event guard deduplicates deliveries by Stripe event ID,',
  'and an existing per-user lock serializes payment updates.',
  'The event guard acquires the existing per-user lock before checking the',
  'committed completion marker, and rechecks after any lock wait. It holds',
  'that lock through the handler and completion bookkeeping; an overlapping',
  'completed duplicate does not invoke the handler.',
  'The new handler runs inside those unchanged guards; this plan does not',
  'replace signature verification, event deduplication, or update locking.',
  'The existing user update assigns payment_status=paid and the payment intent',
  'ID; it does not increment a balance or counter. Repeating the same payment',
  'intent assigns the same values, independently of the event-ID guard.',

  'HTTP 200, logs the event, and stops before user updates or email fan-out.',
  'The retained recipient-policy helper treats a nil or empty email address as',
  'skipped_missing_address: payment processing continues normally, and no mail',
  'client call is attempted. It persists an event/user/PaymentIntent-correlated',
  'skip record, emits a structured warning, and increments the existing counter.',

  'not rescue email errors or change the inline email call below.',
  'The shared mail client also publishes its delivery failure rate to the',

  'The existing incident runbook uses the correlated DB and mail outcomes to',
  'distinguish committed payments from failed notifications. It directs on-call',
  'to check provider status and retry only the failed notification through the',
  'existing notification retry procedure, never replay the payment blindly.',
  'DB lookup/update exceptions propagate to that ingress wrapper, which logs',

  'event-ID dedup guard records completion only after the database transaction',
  'commits; failed or rolled-back database attempts remain retryable.',
  'The deployment already has a handler feature flag and a documented, tested',

  'email delivery, and correlated outcome trace before enabling it broadly.',
  'This is manual deployment verification, not automated handler regression',

  'The existing notification contract sends one payment receipt per PaymentIntent,',
  'including a summary of the user orders. With zero orders it still sends one',
  'receipt with an empty order summary; the order loop is data loading, never',
  'one email or payment update per order. These product semantics are retained.',
  'The shared mail client already derives a provider idempotency key from that',
  'PaymentIntent ID. The provider durably suppresses duplicate successful sends',
  'for the same key across process crashes, webhook retries, and manual retries.',
  'Before rethrowing a failed or timed-out send, that client durably records the',
  'notification attempt for the existing retry procedure. The dashboard and',
  'on-call alert already monitor failed-notification age and backlog after an',
  'outage clears, as well as failure rate; the runbook retries those records.',
  'The existing mail-client deadline is one second, enforced by cancellation',
  'of the provider request with no inline retries. It raises MailTimeout on',
  'expiry. The retained DB/ingress deadlines bound their combined work to two',
