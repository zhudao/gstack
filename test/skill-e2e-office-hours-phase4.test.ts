/**
 * /office-hours Phase 4 alternatives gate regression (periodic, paid, SDK-based).
 *
 * Reproduces the bug seen in production: agent in builder mode reaches Phase 4,
 * presents 3 architectural alternatives (A/B/C), writes "Recommendation: C" in
 * chat prose, and starts editing the design doc immediately — never calls
 * AskUserQuestion. The fix is the STOP gate added to office-hours/SKILL.md.tmpl
 * Phase 4 footer.
 *
 * Test approach: SDK + captureInstruction (same proven pattern as
 * skill-e2e-plan-format.test.ts). Pre-seed builder mode + "skip Phase 1/2/3,
 * I have already accepted all premises" so the agent reaches Phase 4 directly.
 * captureInstruction tells the agent to dump the verbatim Phase 4 AskUserQuestion
 * to a file. We then assert on the captured text (regex + Haiku judge) rather
 * than on tool-call observability — the captured file IS the Phase 4 question.
 *
 * Why periodic (not gate): Phase 4 requires the agent to invent 2-3 distinct
 * architectures, which is more open-ended than the 4 plan-format cases. Closer
 * to a quality benchmark than a deterministic format check. Reclassify if the
 * test turns out stable.

Context: this is BUILDER MODE (Path B). The project is gbrain-retrieval — see README.md. I have a fully-formed plan and have already accepted all your Phase 3 premises. Skip Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 entirely.

Proceed directly to Phase 4 (Alternatives Generation). Generate 2-3 distinct architectural approaches that differ in KIND (not in coverage). Realistic shapes for this project:
  A) Server-side: gbrain ships the retrieval smarts as new MCP tools (e.g. get_recent_salience, find_anomalies).
  B) Client-side: gstack ships a helper (bin/gstack-brain-context-load) that composes salience client-side from existing MCP tools.
  C) Hybrid: V1 client-side in gstack; V1.5 promotes to gbrain server-side once the salience signal is validated.

Do not skip Phase 4 — the test depends on you reaching it.
