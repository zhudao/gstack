/**
 * Per-skill draft-plan seeds engineered to surface at least one
 * review-phase finding in the corresponding plan-* review skill.
 *
 * Used by gate-tier finding-floor tests
 * (test/skill-e2e-plan-{eng,ceo,design,devex}-finding-floor.test.ts) as
 * the minimum-cost regression for the May 2026 transcript bug:
 *   "/plan-eng-review reviewed a real PR diff, wrote a multi-section
 *    review plan to ~/.claude/plans/ and called ExitPlanMode without
 *    ever firing AskUserQuestion."
 *
 * Each seed is small and pre-loaded with one obvious finding the
 * matching skill cannot honestly miss. Floor tests assert
 * `reviewCount >= 1` — i.e., the model fired at least one review-phase
 * AUQ before reaching plan_ready / completion_summary / ceiling.
 *
 * Each seed includes the standard "write your plan-mode plan to /tmp/…"
 * preamble that the existing periodic finding-count fixtures use, so
 * the agent has a concrete plan-file target. The /tmp path is unique
 * per skill to avoid collisions if floor tests run in parallel.
 *
 * For a deeper [N-1, N+2] count band assertion, see the periodic
 * test/skill-e2e-plan-{X}-finding-count.test.ts fixtures.

 * Split-overflow regression seed (periodic tier).
 *
 * Catches the original failure mode the user complained about: when the
 * agent has 5+ options for ONE conceptual decision, it must split into N
 * sequential AskUserQuestion calls (or batch into compatible ≤4-groups),
 * NOT drop an option arbitrarily to fit Conductor's 4-option cap.
 *
 * Fixture shape: 5 independent platform-integration candidates for ONE
 * scope decision. Each is independent (no dependencies between them) so
 * the natural compliant shape is a per-option split chain at parent D<N>.
 *
 * Used by test/skill-e2e-plan-ceo-split-overflow.test.ts to assert the
 * agent fires >= 4 review-phase AUQs (floor uses the standard [N-1]
 * tolerance band, accounting for one expected scope-reduction-or-merge
 * call before the per-option chain begins).
 *
 * Pre-fix behavior: agent fires 1 AUQ with 4 options, "trims" the 5th
 * via prose ("E5 is the largest lift and a natural follow-up; moving to
 * TODOs without asking"). That's the bug. Floor of 4 detects it.
