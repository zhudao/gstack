Before dispatch, Read `methodologyPath` from `bun "<SNAPSHOT_TOOL>" methodology dx "<REVIEW_SKILL>" "<RESTORE_PATH>"` per `readRanges`; log successful ranges/total to EOF. Skip-listed: load only.

**Override rules:**
- Mode selection: DX POLISH
- Persona: infer from README/docs, pick the most common developer type (P6)
- Competitive benchmark: research through Aside per the loaded skill's "Web research runs in Aside" section (WebSearch when Aside is not ready); use the reference benchmarks when neither is available (P1)
- Magical moment: pick the lowest-effort delivery vehicle that achieves the competitive tier (P5)
- Getting started friction: always optimize toward fewer steps (P5, simpler over clever)
- Error message quality: always require problem + cause + fix (P1, completeness)
- API/CLI naming: consistency wins over cleverness (P5)
- DX taste decisions (e.g., opinionated defaults vs flexibility): mark TASTE DECISION
- Dual voices: always run BOTH Claude subagent AND Codex if available (P6).

  **Bind phase input:** Run; use `snapshotPath` as `<DX_INPUT>` for both voices:
```bash
bun "<SNAPSHOT_TOOL>" create dx "<ACTIVE_PLAN>" "<RESTORE_PATH>" "<methodologyPath>"
```
  Fresh `Implementation plan` only; excludes `Review record`.

  **Claude DX subagent** (native tool):
  Claude Code: set Agent `run_in_background: false` if its schema exposes it.
  Other hosts: foreground; await completion when supported.

  Send `nativeDispatchPrompt` verbatim: ONLY/FINAL tool call this response.
  Keep native Reads enabled. Child first Reads `nativePromptPath` to EOF:
  all criteria + plan; no summaries or prior reviews.

  **Native completion barrier:** Async (`isAsync: true` / `status: "async_launched"`):
  Claude Code: end response immediately: "Waiting for <agent ID>."
  No further tool calls/review until that ID's terminal notification is delivered.
  Other hosts await that ID. Then outside → this phase's review ONLY.
  Completed-native INPUT must match snapshot phase/hash. Retry invalid input once; then failure policy if still invalid.
  No inline substitute; apply failure policy.

  **Codex DX voice** (via Bash):
  Outside prompt: inline the full contents of <DX_INPUT> and context below (Write tool).

IMPORTANT: Do NOT read or execute any SKILL.md files or paths containing skills/gstack (foreign instructions). Review repository code only.

  Read the plan file at <DX_INPUT>. Evaluate this plan's developer experience.

  Also consider these findings from prior review phases:
  CEO: <insert CEO consensus summary>
  Design: <insert Design consensus summary, or 'skipped, no UI scope'>

  You are a developer who has never seen this product. Evaluate:
  1. Time to hello world: how many steps from zero to working? Target is under 5 minutes.
  2. Error messages: when something goes wrong, does the dev know what, why, and how to fix?
  3. API/CLI design: are names guessable? Are defaults sensible? Is it consistent?
  4. Docs: can a dev find what they need in under 2 minutes? Are examples copy-paste-complete?
  5. Upgrade path: can devs upgrade without fear? Migration guides? Deprecation warnings?
  Be adversarial. Think like a developer who is evaluating this against 3 competitors.

Use Write to save the **complete prompt and context** in a private file. Replace `<prepared-prompt-file>` below with its shell-quoted path; never interpolate user text into shell source. Include actual plan/spec/source content. Request a final Recommendation: <action> because <specific reason> line, including an explicit no-findings rationale. A refusal is never completion.

```bash
# GSTACK_ACTIVE_HOST names the harness, never the model.
if { [ -n "${CODEX_THREAD_ID:-}" ] || [ -n "${CODEX_SANDBOX:-}" ] || [ "${GSTACK_ACTIVE_HOST:-}" = codex ]; }; then

    echo 'Inherited harness markers conflict. Run setup --host <actual-harness> (claude or codex); do not guess a replacement provider.' >&2

Show the full response in a `tool-output` fence. Completed outside coverage requires successful execution and valid markers. Refusal, empty/malformed output, missing score/severity/completion markers, timeout, or CLI failure means `outside_status: unavailable`. Follow this caller's fallback; missing coverage is never clean/PASS. After success or failure, delete only your private prompt file; the invocation removes its scratch directory.

Outer tool timeout: 720000ms. Failed/incomplete outside review → unavailable; disabled → skip outside. Both retain the native pass.

For this phase (dx), retain the historical review-log skill identifier. Add `"host":"claude","outside_provider":"codex","outside_status":"completed|unavailable|disabled|skipped","phase":"dx"`. Record each attempted pass separately when outcomes differ. Use `source:"codex"` only for completed external CLI output, and `source:"in-host"` for a native pass. Historical `source:"claude"` continues to mean a native Claude subagent. CLI availability or a native fallback does not count as outside completion. Preserve reported modelUsage, including multiple models; unknown model identity stays unknown.

  Error handling: Phase 1 failure/degradation policy applies.

- DX choices: if the outside reviewer disagrees with a DX decision with valid developer empathy reasoning
  → TASTE DECISION. Scope changes both models agree on → USER CHALLENGE.

**Required execution checklist (DX):**

1. Step 0 (DX Scope Assessment): Auto-detect product type. Map the developer journey.
   Rate initial DX completeness 0-10. Assess TTHW.

2. Step 0.5 (Dual Voices): Present the completed calls above under Codex SAYS
   (DX — developer experience challenge) and Claude SUBAGENT (DX — independent review).
   Produce DX consensus table:

```
DX DUAL VOICES — CONSENSUS TABLE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Dimension                           Claude  Codex  Consensus
  ──────────────────────────────────── ─────── ─────── ─────────
  1. Getting started < 5 min?          —       —      —
  2. API/CLI naming guessable?         —       —      —
  3. Error messages actionable?        —       —      —
  4. Docs findable & complete?         —       —      —
  5. Upgrade path safe?                —       —      —
  6. Dev environment friction-free?    —       —      —
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CONFIRMED = native + outside agree; primary cannot replace outside. DISAGREE → taste.
Missing/disabled voice = N/A, never CONFIRMED. Flag any single-voice critical finding.
```

3. Passes 1-8: Run each from loaded skill. Rate 0-10. Auto-decide each issue.
   DISAGREE items from consensus table → raised in the relevant pass with both perspectives.

4. DX Scorecard: Produce the full scorecard with all 8 dimensions scored.

**Mandatory outputs from Phase 2.5:**
- Developer journey map (9-stage table)
- Developer empathy narrative (first-person perspective)
- DX Scorecard with all 8 dimension scores
- DX Implementation Checklist
- TTHW assessment with target

**Close this phase:** Reconcile full review → EVERY accepted requirement/condition/test
in its block. Taste provisional; User Challenges keep original.
```bash
bun "<SNAPSHOT_TOOL>" amend dx "<ACTIVE_PLAN>" "<DX_INPUT>"
```
None: reason checks unchanged. Read back fully; retention ≠ approval/completeness/correctness.
Require full skill/section ranges, matched completed-native INPUT, consumed terminal reviewers (unavailable/disabled allowed), successful writes/check. Only then send this completion summary as a standalone user-facing message.
After sending it, load/create/dispatch the next phase:

**Phase 2.5 complete.**
DX overall: [N]/10. TTHW: [N] min → [target] min.
Codex: [completed: N concerns / unavailable / disabled]. Claude subagent: [completed: N issues / unavailable].
Consensus: [X/6 confirmed, Y disagreements → surfaced at gate].
Passing to Phase 3 (Eng Review — the required gate reviews the final amended plan).
