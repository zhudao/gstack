## Phase 3: The Complete Proposal

Develop your draft with the design knowledge below. Compare completed outside proposals: explain agreements, differences, and ideas adopted with attribution. Tie the recommendation to the memorable-thing answer. Do not count agreement as a vote or invent a missing proposal. Q2 names completed, unavailable, or declined voices and presents the recommendation.

**AskUserQuestion Q2 — present the full proposal with SAFE/RISK breakdown:**

```
Based on [product context] and [research findings / my design knowledge]:

AESTHETIC: [direction] — [one-line rationale]
DECORATION: [level] — [why this pairs with the aesthetic]
LAYOUT: [approach] — [why this fits the product type]
COLOR: [approach] + proposed palette (hex values) — [rationale]
TYPOGRAPHY: [3 font recommendations with roles] — [why these fonts]
SPACING: [base unit + density] — [rationale]
MOTION: [approach] — [rationale]

This system is coherent because [explain how choices reinforce each other].

INDEPENDENT INPUT: [completed/unavailable/skipped voices; agreements, differences, ideas adopted and product-specific reasons — omit comparisons if none completed]

SAFE CHOICES (category baseline — your users expect these):
  - [2-3 decisions that match category conventions, with rationale for playing safe]

RISKS (where your product gets its own face):
  - [2-3 deliberate departures from convention]
  - For each risk: what it is, why it works, what you gain, what it costs

The safe choices keep you literate in your category. The risks are where
your product becomes memorable. Which risks appeal to you? Want to see
different ones? Or adjust anything else?
```

Coherence alone can look generic. Propose at least 2 creative risks—type, accent, spacing, layout or motion—with rationale, benefit and cost alongside the category's safe choices.

**Options:** A) Looks great — generate the preview page. B) I want to adjust [section]. C) I want different risks — show me wilder options. D) Start over with a different direction. E) Skip the preview, just write DESIGN.md.

### Your Design Knowledge (use to inform proposals — do NOT display as tables)

**Calibration: the three looks.** Avoid predictable compositions: cream/serif/terracotta; near-black/neon/glowing edges; or broadsheet hairlines/italic serif/tiny tracked mono. Use one only when the brief specifically calls for it. Otherwise choose a direction grounded in these users, rather than the category stereotype or its obvious opposite. For example, a book product can draw color from jackets and cloth instead of defaulting to cream and serif.

**Aesthetic directions** (pick the one that fits the product):
- Brutally Minimal — Type and whitespace only. No decoration. Modernist.
- Maximalist Chaos — Dense, layered, pattern-heavy. Y2K meets contemporary.
- Retro-Futuristic — Vintage tech nostalgia. Phosphor palette, bitmap type, warm monospace for data (no glow halos, no grid-paper backgrounds).
- Luxury/Refined — Serifs, high contrast, generous whitespace, precious metals.
- Playful/Toy-like — Rounded, springy (no overshoot), bold primaries. Approachable and fun.
- Editorial/Magazine — Strong typographic hierarchy, asymmetric grids, pull quotes.
- Brutalist/Raw — Exposed structure, one utilitarian grotesk, visible grid, no polish (a system stack only when the user asks for it by name).
- Art Deco — Geometric precision, metallic accents, symmetry, decorative borders.
- Organic/Natural — Earth tones, rounded forms, hand-drawn texture, grain.
- Industrial/Utilitarian — Function-first, data-dense, monospace accents, muted palette.

**Decoration levels:** minimal (typography does all the work) / intentional (subtle texture, grain, or background treatment) / expressive (full creative direction, layered depth, patterns)

**Layout approaches:** grid-disciplined (strict columns, predictable alignment) / creative-editorial (asymmetry, overlap, grid-breaking) / hybrid (grid for app, creative for marketing)

**Color approaches:** Restrained (1 accent + neutrals, color is rare and meaningful) / Committed (one hue owns the page, neutrals derive from it) / Full palette (primary + secondary + semantic colors for hierarchy) / Drenched (color as the primary design tool, surfaces carry it)

**Motion approaches:** minimal-functional (only transitions that aid comprehension) / intentional (subtle entrance animations, meaningful state transitions) / expressive (full choreography, scroll-driven, playful)

**Choosing faces: a procedure, not a menu.** (1) Name the audience and surface mode: Persuade (marketing), Operate (tasks), Read (long content), or Experience (immersive). Choose the corresponding tone. (2) Shortlist three faces per display/body/label/mono role. (3) Apply role exclusions. (4) Verify via WebSearch/Aside on Google Fonts/Fontshare, or local files and licenses; omit unverified faces. (5) Specify loading strategy.

**Font-verification fallback:** Skipping competitive research does not waive font verification. Offline, check local files/licenses. Otherwise describe roles/weights/proportions; mark font selection as pending verification in DESIGN.md. Continue palette/layout; defer the preview until fonts can be verified, or honor a user skip. Invent no face or URL.

**Overused as display** (never the display voice, on any surface; the body/UI exception below is the only one; the detector flags several as `overused-font`): Inter, Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, Open Sans, Lato, Montserrat, Poppins, Space Grotesk, Space Mono, Fraunces, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Lora, Crimson, Newsreader, Syne, IBM Plex Sans, IBM Plex Serif, DM Sans, DM Serif, Outfit, Plus Jakarta Sans, Instrument Sans, Geist.

**Fine as body/UI on an Operate or Read surface when the proposal says so:** DM Sans, Instrument Sans, IBM Plex Sans. **Mono for data and code:** JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono, Fira Code.

**Banned in any role:** Papyrus, Comic Sans, Lobster, Impact, Jokerman, Bleeding Cowboys, Permanent Marker, Bradley Hand, Brush Script, Hobo, Trajan, Raleway, Clash Display, Courier New.

**Freely available faces on no default list** (verified 2026-09-08; re-verify in-session; see font-verification fallback if offline): Satoshi, General Sans, Clash Grotesk, Cabinet Grotesk (Fontshare); Instrument Serif, Source Sans 3, JetBrains Mono, Fira Code (Google Fonts). Short on purpose. A long list of "good" fonts is how the last convergence happened.

User asks for a listed face by name: comply, state the tradeoff once.

**Anti-convergence directive:** VARY aesthetic, faces and palette across project generations; justify repetition. Light vs dark is not one of the dials: fix it to the use scene (who, where, lighting) until that scene changes. Unjustified convergence is slop.

**AI slop anti-patterns** (never include in your recommendations):
- Purple/violet/indigo gradient backgrounds or blue-to-purple color schemes
- **The 3-column feature grid:** icon-in-colored-circle + bold title + 2-line description, repeated 3x symmetrically. THE most recognizable AI layout.
- Icons in colored circles as section decoration (SaaS starter template look)
- Centered everything (`text-align: center` on all headings, descriptions, cards)
- Uniform bubbly border-radius on every element (same large radius on everything)
- Decorative blobs, floating circles, wavy SVG dividers (if a section feels empty, it needs better content, not decoration)
- Emoji as design elements (rockets in headings, emoji as bullet points)
- Colored left-border on cards (`border-left: 3px solid <accent>`)
- Generic hero copy ("Welcome to [X]", "Unlock the power of...", "Your all-in-one solution for...")
- Cookie-cutter section rhythm (hero → 3 features → testimonials → pricing → CTA, every section same height)
- system-ui or `-apple-system` as the PRIMARY display/body font — the "I gave up on typography" signal. Pick a real typeface.
- A colored edge on a rounded card: the side-tab in a costume. Signal state with a background tint, an icon, or a label.
- A training-data default as the display voice means you stopped looking. As body or UI on an Operate or Read surface, several of these are fine. Say which and why.
- Headings within a step of body size. Pick a scale and let the levels differ by more than a weight.
- Emphasis is weight or size. Gradient text is emphasis in a costume.
- Cream ground, serif display, terracotta accent: look number one. Fine when the brief asked for it; a default when it did not.
- A card inside a card is always wrong. Cards are the lazy container; nesting them is the lazy container squared.
- An illustration built from CSS shapes standing in for an asset. Produce the asset or ship nothing.
- Glowing edges on dark surfaces: look number two. Depth has an offset; a zero-offset colored halo is decoration.
- A radial gradient halo behind the hero content. Look number two again.
- A spotlight glow washing the top of the page. Same family as the halo.
- An infinitely scrolling logo strip. If the logos matter, show them still; if they do not, cut them.
- The rounded-square icon above every heading. Try side by side, or drop the container.
- Look three: the italic display serif reaching for editorial credibility. Earn it with the content or set the display upright.
- A pill-shaped label floating above the hero headline. The headline carries its own weight; cut the chip.
- A kicker above a heading is the strongest default there is: the heading carries its own weight, so delete the label. If the user wants it anyway, comply and say the tradeoff once.
- "Seamless", "effortless", "supercharge", "streamline": words that describe nothing. Say what the product does.
- Short. Punchy. Fragments. Every sentence a slogan. Write like a person explaining something.
- Display type past 6rem on a page that is not a poster. Size is not hierarchy.
- "Built for the way you work", "Designed for teams like yours", "Meet your new...": phrases that perform a launch instead of describing one.
- Gradient buttons as the primary call to action. One solid color the palette owns.
- A generic stock-photo hero, or a gray placeholder div standing in for one. Show the product or show nothing.
- Rounded cards with drop shadows as the container for everything. App UI made of stacked cards is not layout.
- A testimonial row with avatars, five stars, and quotes nobody said. Real names with real claims, or cut it.
- The cookie-cutter hero: headline left, screenshot right, two buttons. The first template every generator reaches for.
- "Get Started" and "Learn More" as the only calls to action. Name the outcome the click buys.
- Three big numbers with tiny labels under the hero ("10k+ users", "99.9%"). The template counts, not the product.
- A grid of cards with the same shape, the same icon slot, the same two lines. Content of unequal weight given equal boxes.
- Frosted-glass panels with blurred backdrops as the default surface. One translucent layer where it explains depth, not everywhere.
- Generated SVG doodles and mascots in place of art direction. Commission or license an asset, or ship none.
- Every secondary action in a modal. Inline, a side panel, or a new page usually costs the user less.
- Sparklines, progress rings, and fake avatars filling space where content should be. Real data or an honest empty state.
- Dark because it is a dev tool, light because it is health. Light or dark comes from the use scene: who, where, under what light.
- Only the happy path is designed. Empty, loading, error, and long-content states are part of the component.

### Coherence Validation

After any override, gently flag mismatches and offer alternatives: Brutalist/Minimal + expressive motion → quieter motion or keep intentionally; Drenched + minimal decoration → supporting decoration; editorial + dense data → hybrid layout. Never block; accept the user's final choice and proceed.

---

## Phase 4: Drill-downs (only if user requests adjustments)

Use one focused AskUserQuestion per requested drill-down: **Fonts:** 3-5 candidates, rationale/evocation and preview offer; **Colors:** 2-3 hex palettes and color theory; **Aesthetic:** product-fit directions and why; **Layout/Spacing/Motion:** concrete product-specific tradeoffs. Re-check coherence after each decision.

---

## Phase 5: Design System Preview (default ON)

Preview the proposed system using the available path.

### Path A: AI Mockups (if DESIGN_READY)

Generate AI mockups applying the proposed system to realistic product screens.

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
_DESIGN_DIR="$HOME/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/designs/design-system-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
mkdir -p "$_DESIGN_DIR"
echo "DESIGN_DIR: $_DESIGN_DIR"
```

Brief: Phase 3 aesthetic/colors/type/spacing/layout plus Phase 1 product context:

```bash
$D variants --brief "<product name: [name]. Product type: [type]. Aesthetic: [direction]. Colors: primary [hex], secondary [hex], neutrals [range]. Typography: display [font], body [font]. Layout: [approach]. Show a realistic [page type] screen with [specific content for this product].>" --count 3 --output-dir "$_DESIGN_DIR/"
```

Run quality check on each variant:

```bash
$D check --image "$_DESIGN_DIR/variant-A.png" --brief "<the original brief>"
```

Read each PNG to show the variants inline.

**Before presenting, self-gate:** Would a human designer be embarrassed to sign each variant? If yes, discard and regenerate. Hard rejects: purple gradient hero, 3-column SaaS grid, centered-everything, overused display face, generic stock photo, system-ui, gradient CTA, bubble-radius everything. Any trigger requires regeneration.

Open the board before inviting the user to choose or remix.

### Comparison Board + Feedback Loop

Create the comparison board and serve it over HTTP:

```bash
$D compare --images "$_DESIGN_DIR/variant-A.png,$_DESIGN_DIR/variant-B.png,$_DESIGN_DIR/variant-C.png" --output "$_DESIGN_DIR/design-board.html" --serve
```

Creates HTML and opens the board. **Run it in the background** (host task, or `&` redirecting stdout/stderr to private files in `$_DESIGN_DIR`). Read captured stderr for the startup marker; a PID is not readiness. Missing marker: use the failure fallback below.

Default stderr: `BOARD_URL: http://127.0.0.1:N/boards/<id>/`. Use that full per-board URL for AskUserQuestion and as the reload base. Only explicit legacy `--no-daemon` emits `SERVE_STARTED: port=XXXXX`, serving one board at `/` with reload at `/api/reload`.

**PRIMARY WAIT: AskUserQuestion with board URL**

Once serving, wait with AskUserQuestion including the board URL:

"I've opened a comparison board with the design variants:
<BOARD_URL> — Rate them, leave comments, remix
elements you like, and click Submit when you're done. Let me know when you've
submitted your feedback (or paste your preferences here). If you clicked
Regenerate or Remix on the board, tell me and I'll generate new variants."

Substitute `<BOARD_URL>` from the stderr marker above.

**The user chooses variants in the board; AskUserQuestion only waits.**

**After the user responds to AskUserQuestion:**

Check for feedback files next to the board HTML:
- `$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback.json` — written when user clicks Submit (final choice)
- `$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback-pending.json` — written when user clicks Regenerate/Remix/More Like This

```bash
if [ -f "$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback.json" ]; then
  echo "SUBMIT_RECEIVED"
  cat "$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback.json"
elif [ -f "$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback-pending.json" ]; then
  echo "REGENERATE_RECEIVED"
  cat "$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback-pending.json"
  rm "$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback-pending.json"
else
  echo "NO_FEEDBACK_FILE"
fi
```

The feedback JSON has this shape:
```json
{
  "preferred": "A",
  "ratings": { "A": 4, "B": 3, "C": 2 },
  "comments": { "A": "Love the spacing" },
  "overall": "Go with A, bigger CTA",
  "regenerated": false
}
```

**If `feedback.json` found:** The user clicked Submit on the board.
Read `preferred`, `ratings`, `comments`, `overall` from the JSON. Proceed with
the approved variant.

**If `feedback-pending.json` found:** The user clicked Regenerate/Remix on the board.
1. Read `regenerateAction` from the JSON (`"different"`, `"match"`, `"more_like_B"`,
   `"remix"`, or custom text)
2. If `regenerateAction` is `"remix"`, read `remixSpec` (e.g. `{"layout":"A","colors":"B"}`)
3. Generate new variants with `$D iterate` or `$D variants` using updated brief
4. Create new board: `$D compare --images "..." --output "$_DESIGN_DIR/design-board.html"`
5. Reload the board in the user's browser (same tab) — the URL is per-board
   under daemon mode, so use `<BOARD_URL>` (from the `BOARD_URL:` stderr
   line) as the base:
   `jq -nc --arg html "$_DESIGN_DIR/design-board.html" '{html: $html}' | curl -sS -X POST "${BOARD_URL}api/reload" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @-`
   Under `--no-daemon` the reload endpoint is `/api/reload` at the legacy
   port; this path only matters if the caller explicitly opted out of the
   daemon.
6. The board auto-refreshes. **AskUserQuestion again** with the same board URL to
   wait for the next round of feedback. Repeat until `feedback.json` appears.

**If `NO_FEEDBACK_FILE`:** The user typed their preferences directly in the
AskUserQuestion response instead of using the board. Use their text response
as the feedback.

Exit 0 with `BOARD_URL` means the daemon is serving; use the board feedback flow above.
**SERVER FALLBACK:** Nonzero exit or no readiness marker: show each variant inline using the Read tool (so the user can see them),
then use AskUserQuestion:
"The comparison board server failed to start. I've shown the variants above.
Which do you prefer? Any feedback?"

**After receiving feedback (any path):** Output a clear summary confirming
what was understood:

"Here's what I understood from your feedback:
PREFERRED: Variant [X]
RATINGS: [list]
YOUR NOTES: [comments]
DIRECTION: [overall]

Is this right?"

Use AskUserQuestion to verify before proceeding.

**Save the approved choice:**
```bash
echo '{"approved_variant":"<V>","feedback":"<FB>","date":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","screen":"<SCREEN>","branch":"'$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)'"}' > "$_DESIGN_DIR/approved.json"
```

After the user picks a direction:

- `$D extract --image "$_DESIGN_DIR/variant-<CHOSEN>.png"`: Phase 6 color/type/spacing tokens come from the approved visual, not text alone.
- Further iteration: `$D iterate --feedback "<user's feedback>" --output "$_DESIGN_DIR/refined.png"`

**Plan mode:** Carry the approved mockup paths/tokens into Phase 6's "## Proposed DESIGN.md" plan section. Its Q-final approval governs saving that content; defer the actual DESIGN.md to implementation.

### Path B: HTML Preview Page (fallback if DESIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE)

Create and open the HTML preview:

```bash
PREVIEW_FILE="/tmp/design-consultation-preview-$(date +%s).html"
```

Write the preview HTML to `$PREVIEW_FILE`, then open it:

```bash
open "$PREVIEW_FILE"
```

### Preview Page Requirements (Path B only)

Write a **single, self-contained HTML file**, no frameworks:

1. **Loads proposed fonts** via `<link>` from their step (4) verified Google Fonts/Fontshare/self-hosted source.
2. **Uses the proposed palette** throughout.
3. **Shows the product name**, not Lorem Ipsum, in the hero.
4. **Font specimen section:**
   - Each candidate in its hero/body/button/table role; compare same-role alternatives side by side using real domain content (e.g. civic tech: government data).
5. **Color palette section:**
   - Named hex swatches; primary/secondary/ghost buttons, cards, inputs, success/warning/error/info alerts; background/text contrast pairs.
6. **Realistic product mockups:** Render 2-3 Phase 1 product-type layouts with the full system, product name, domain content and proposed spacing/layout/radii:
   - **Dashboard/web app:** metrics table, sidebar nav, avatar header, stat cards.
   - **Marketing:** real-copy hero, features, testimonials, CTA.
   - **Settings/admin:** labeled inputs, toggles, dropdowns, save.
   - **Auth/onboarding:** branded login, social buttons, validation states.
7. **Light/dark toggle:** CSS custom properties plus a JS button.
8. **Clean, professional layout.**
9. **Responsive** at every width.

Show how their product feels, beyond a font/color inventory.

If `open` fails (headless environment), tell the user: *"I wrote the preview to [path] — open it in your browser to see the fonts and colors rendered."*

If the user says skip the preview, go directly to Phase 6.

---

## Phase 6: Write DESIGN.md & Confirm

Only Path A invokes `$D extract` for approved mockup tokens. For Path B, use the approved HTML preview's CSS values. No preview: approved Phase 3 values with pending fonts. Retain Phase 3 rationale.

**Confirm before writing.** Prepare the contents below; show decisions and agent-selected defaults. AskUserQuestion Q-final:
- A) Approve — write DESIGN.md and CLAUDE.md; in plan mode, save Proposed DESIGN.md in the plan only
- B) Revise — return to Phase 3, then confirm again
- C) Start over — return to Phase 1

Wait. Only A permits the writes below; B/C leave project files untouched. Honor prior explicit approval of these exact writes without re-asking.

**If in plan mode:** Write the DESIGN.md content into the plan file as a "## Proposed DESIGN.md" section. Do NOT write the actual file — that happens at implementation time.

**If NOT in plan mode:** Write root `DESIGN.md` in google-labs-code/design.md format. All tokens belong in the five normative YAML groups below; prose explains rationale/use without repeating values. Preserve the line-2 format marker to prevent conversion re-asks. A Phase 0 kept-legacy file instead retains its own shape.

# [Project Name]

## Overview

**Creative North Star:** [one sentence: aesthetic + why it fits these users]
**Product context:** [product, users, category/peers, project type]
**Mode per surface:** [one line each: Persuade / Operate / Read / Experience]
**Reference sites:** [URLs, if research was done]
**Key characteristics:** [3-5 bullets: first-five-second impressions]

## Colors

**Strategy:** [Restrained / Committed / Full palette / Drenched] — [why]
**Light or dark:** [decided by the use scene: who, where, under what light]
[Explain which tokens signal interaction or emphasis, how neutrals derive from the palette, and how dark-mode surfaces preserve hierarchy rather than merely inverting lightness.]

## Typography

[Faces' source world, mode/register, roles and display boundaries; loading, scale rationale, justified overused-list exceptions]

## Layout

[Breakpoint grids, max width, density, large/small spacing rhythm, intentional grid breaks]

## Elevation & Depth

[Depth: offset + soft-blur shadows, tints, borders; no zero-offset glow]

## Shapes

[Radius hierarchy/uses; nested inner radius = outer radius − gap]

## Components

[Per component: hover/focus-visible/active/disabled states, invariants and adaptations]

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do: [3-5 specific, checkable rules]
- Don't: [3-5 system-specific anti-patterns, including this category's tempting catalog entries]

## Motion

- **Approach:** [minimal-functional / intentional / expressive]
- **Easing:** enter(ease-out) exit(ease-in) move(ease-in-out)
- **Duration:** micro(50-100ms) short(150-250ms) medium(250-400ms) long(400-700ms)
- **The one authored moment:** [what it is]

## Decisions Log
| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| [today] | Initial design system created | Created by /design-consultation based on [product context / research] |
```

Use real token values, no placeholders; omit invented `components` entries. Outside plan mode, after writing DESIGN.md, require `bun --no-env-file run ~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-design-md.ts check DESIGN.md` to print `DESIGN_MD_FORMAT: spec`.

**Outside plan mode, update CLAUDE.md** (or create it if it doesn't exist) — append this section:

```markdown
## Design System
Always read DESIGN.md before making any visual or UI decisions.
All font choices, colors, spacing, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.
In QA mode, flag any code that doesn't match DESIGN.md.
```

After shipping DESIGN.md, if the session produced screen-level mockups or page layouts
(not just system-level tokens), suggest:
"Want to see this design system as working Pretext-native HTML? Run /design-html."
